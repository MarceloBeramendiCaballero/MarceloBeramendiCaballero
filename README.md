<h1>Hello, I'm Marcelo!</h1>
I'm interested in using artificial intelligence and machine learning to study neuroscience and human cognition. Below is a list of the projects I have worked on.

<h2> Projects:</h2>

- <b>Neuroscience</b>
  - [Predicting the amount of food swallowed during Aplysia californica feeding from neural recordings](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/AplysiaQuantitativeBehavioralPredictions/tree/main)

- <b>Cognitive Science</b>
  - [The propagation of political beliefs in social networks](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/belief-propagation-in-social-networks/tree/main)

<h3> Under Construction</h2>
