<h1>Hello, I'm Marcelo!</h1>
During my time at CWRU, I worked on several projects that combine AI, ML, and mathematical/computational modeling approaches to study both neuroscience and human cognition. Below is a list of some of these projects.

<h2> Projects:</h2>

- <b>Neuroscience</b>
  - [Predicting the amount of food swallowed during Aplysia californica feeding from neural recordings](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/AplysiaQuantitativeBehavioralPredictions/tree/main)
  - [Modeling the heating process of Aplysia californica's pleural-abdominal nerve under infrared inhibition](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/infrared-neuromodulation-model/tree/main)
  - [Motor learning of the optokinetic response: implementing a simple model of the cerebellar circuit](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/motor-learning-of-optokinetic-response/tree/main)

- <b>Cognitive Science</b>
  - [Modeling the propagation of political beliefs in social networks](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/belief-propagation-in-social-networks/tree/main)
  - [Decision trees as a computational model for mental heuristics in human decision-making: a study of poker duels](https://github.com/MarceloBeramendiCaballero/decision-trees-in-poker-duels)
